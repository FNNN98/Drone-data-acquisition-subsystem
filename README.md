## Description 
This project is powered by a STM32F767ZI and a X-NUCLEO-IKS01A2. 

It consists in a FREERTOS based data acquisition subsystem as part of a flight control software for a rotary-wing drone.


By using the HAL provided by ST, the task taski2cR() acquire the following RawData from the sensors on the IKS01A2 and save it on the sensorData struct:

- LPS22HB Barometer
  Sensor polled with ODR set to 50 Hz

Data is acquired in Hectopascal (hPa)

- LSM6DSL Accelerometer
  Sensor polled with ODR set to 833 Hz,
  FS = ±2 with 0.61 mg/LSB sensitivity
  
Data is later converted into the tridimensional vector of acceleration (rad·sec^−1)

- LSM6DSL Gyroscope
  Sensor polled with ODR set to 833 Hz,
  FS = ±2000 with 70 mdps/LSB sensitivity
  
Data is later converted into the tridimensional vector of angular speeds (rad·sec^−1)

- LSM303AGR Accelerometer
  Sensor polled with ODR set to 200 Hz,
  FS = ±2 g with 3.9 mg/LSB sensitivity

Data is later converted into the tridimensional vector of acceleration (rad·sec^−1)

- LSM303AGR Magnetometer
  Sensor polled with ODR set to 100 Hz,
  1.5 mgauss/LSB sensitivity
Data is later converted into the tridimensional vector of magnetic flux (microT)


*Accelerometer RawData from the LSM6DSL and the LSM303AGR is then averaged and saved on a data struct. 


A second task startPrintUart() , operating at 0.5hz, uses a custom _write() function to transmit real-time data over UART which can be read from the console.

## Scheduling
The 5 tasks tControlMotor(), tAttitude(), tAltitude(), startPrintUart() and taski2cR() have been scheduled according to Rate Monotonic Scheduling.

Moreover, the system appears to be compliant with CPU utilization estimations (0.3844 < 0.7568) and the Hyperbolic Bound for RM results in 1.4046 which is below the 2.0000 threshold. It's fair to assume that the system is fully compliant with the scheduling implementation.

Given the inability to provide thread-safe I2C communications between the Nucleo board and the shield when using the HAL provided by ST in the case of running multiple tasks accessing to the I2C bus in a non-mutually exclusive way, I made the architectural decisions to use a single task running at 500hz to acquire data from the 4 sensors.

Considering that both taskI2cR() and startPrintUart() appear to write and read on the sensorData struct I decided to use the osSemaphores provided by FREERTOS to introduce a simple but functional binary semaphore to grant mutually exclusive access to the data stored in the struct.

Since startPrintUart() is the lowest priority task among the existing ones and since we are in a system where the use of preemption is allowed, one could generate the case in which startPrintUart, following the acquisition of the semaphore is interrupted by taskI2cR() which would not be able to acquire the semaphore that has not yet been released by the other task.

This was solved by implementing the Priority Inheritance Protocol (PIP): at the start of the StartPrintUart task, I therefore decided
to immediately raise the priority level of the task via the primitive printUart_attributes.priority =
osPriorityNormal7 which temporarily allows the task to inherit the priority of the higher priority task,
i.e. taskI2cR, and then acquire the semaphore, print, release the semaphore and finally return to its original priority
via printUart_attributes.priority = osPriorityNormal3.
